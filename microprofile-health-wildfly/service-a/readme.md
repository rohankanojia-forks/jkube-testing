# MicroProfile generated Application

## Introduction

MicroProfile Starter has generated this MicroProfile application for you.

The generation of the executable jar file can be performed by issuing the following command


    mvn clean package

This will create an executable jar file **microprofile-health-wildfly-bootable.jar** within the _target_ maven folder. This can be started by executing the following command

    java -jar target/microprofile-health-wildfly-bootable.jar




To launch the test page, open your browser at the following URL

    http://localhost:8080/index.html  


## Next Step

Leave the server-a server running and proceed with the instructions contained in `demo/service-b/readme.md`.


## Specification examples

By default, there is always the creation of a JAX-RS application class to define the path on which the JAX-RS endpoints are available.

Also, a simple Hello world endpoint is created, have a look at the class **HelloController**.

More information on MicroProfile can be found [here](https://microprofile.io/)


### Health

The health status can be used to determine if the 'computing node' needs to be discarded/restarted or not. Specification [here](https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-health)

The class **ServiceHealthCheck** contains an example of a custom check which can be integrated to health status checks of the instance.  The index page contains a link to the status data.

### Rest Client

A type safe invocation of HTTP rest endpoints. Specification [here](https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-rest-client)

The example calls one endpoint from another JAX-RS resource where generated Rest Client is injected as CDI bean.
